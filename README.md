# NetCompute 2026

**First Workshop on Computation over Heterogeneous Networks**

NetCompute 2026 explores the intersection of computation and communication networks, where the structure and dynamics of networks fundamentally shape how we process, learn, and make decisions from data.

## Workshop Details

- **Date:** May 18, 2026
- **Location:** Tokyo, Japan
- **Conference:** In conjunction with IEEE INFOCOM 2026
- **Website:** [netcompute.org](https://netcompute.org)

## About

As computing moves beyond centralized data centers to edge devices, IoT sensors, satellites, and mobile platforms, the network itself becomes a critical constraint and enabler for distributed intelligence. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to address the unique challenges of computation over heterogeneous networks, including:

- **Communication-constrained computation:** Optimizing algorithms when bandwidth, latency, and reliability vary across network segments
- **Network heterogeneity:** Managing diverse device capabilities, topologies, and communication protocols
- **Distributed intelligence:** Enabling learning, inference, and optimization across networked systems
- **Real-world deployments:** Bridging theory and practice in edge AI, federated learning, and networked control

## Topics of Interest

We invite original research contributions, position papers, and work-in-progress reports addressing computation over heterogeneous networks, including but not limited to:

- In-Network Compute
- Topology-Aware Scheduling
- Communication-Aware Learning
- Federated and Split Learning
- Edge Intelligence & Inference
- Satellite & Space Networks
- IoT & Sensor Networks
- Network-Aware Optimization
- Mobile & Vehicular Computing
- Wireless Networks & Computation
- Privacy & Security
- Benchmarks & Testbeds
- Applications & Case Studies

## Important Dates

- **Paper Submission Deadline:** December 29, 2025
- **Notification of Acceptance:** February 2, 2026
- **Camera-Ready Deadline:** February 16, 2026
- **Workshop Date:** May 18, 2026

*All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere on Earth)*
